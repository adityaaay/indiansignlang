# Converts Indian Sign Language to Text
# Abstract
##### Sign language is one of the oldest and most natural form of language for communication. In our community today, contact with hearing impaired (deaf/mute) persons is a major challenge. This can be attributed to the fact that their method of communication (sign language or hand gestures at community level) requires an intermediary at all levels. We have thought of a constant strategy utilizing neural organizations for fingerspelling dependent on Indian gesture-based communication. In our technique, the hand is first gone through a filter and after the filter is applied the hand is passed through a classier that predicts the class of the hand motions.

# Objectives
##### 1. To build a neural network to recognize hand signs.
##### 2. To convert the hand signs from Indian Sign Language to text in real time.

# Literature Survey
#### Taking Literature Survery as our foremost support, we have provided sup- port that the earliest phases of hand gesture are:
###### 1. Data Collection
###### 2. Data Pre-processing
###### 3. Feature Extraction
###### 4. Gesture Classification
